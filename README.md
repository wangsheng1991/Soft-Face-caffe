Facial Landmark Detection with Softmax Classification
================================================================
Detecting Face landmark is one of the most challenging field of Deep Learning. <br />
Landmark is a point of eyes, eyebrow, nose, lips. <br />
Thousands of papers have been submitted since 2014. Also, detecting accuracies are getting better and better. <br />
Before describing SoftFace, Here are top trends <br />

Top Trends
----------------------------------------------------------
1. Detecting face landmark with some algorithms, detectors
2. Using deep neural network(regression based)

I propose a novel method of detecting it. <br />
In SoftFace, second architecture is used(a.k.a CNN). not REGRESSION but SOFTMAX <br />
